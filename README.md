# LemmeGIG

LET ME GIG! As musicians we spend so much time on organizing stuff and gathering documents, lyrics, notation last minute, 
so each practice becomes and 1/3 organzation, 1/3 talking and 1/3 actual rehearsing. Not you? Well that's my experience at least, 
having in mind that different projects use different media storing and messaging apps.

At LemmeGIG we try to get all those chores under one roof and slowly but surely build an ecosystem where your gig data, docs and materials "live".

## Main functionalities

- Rehearsals - gather and share materials, demos and working docs; schedule and attend rehearsals
- Virtual Stage - all members of a band can simultaneously see and make changes to songlist, chords (WIP) etc.
- Calendar (under construction)
- Affiche - all users public events, so that others can pay them a visit and support them

## Licence and usage

Currently, this project is still a baby and any code as of now (until further notice) can be used freely, but not for commercial goals.
If the project survives baby-phase, it could be open for contribution. 

The project can be found on http://lemmegig.com where artist can make their profiles and start using the app, 
but bands can feel free to fork, fine tune and host the project themselves for their music journey.
